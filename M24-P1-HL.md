1. [Maximum mark: 4] Solve $\tan(2x-5ยบ) = 1$ for $0ยบ \leq 180ยบ$. 
2. [Maximum mark: 5] Solve $3 \times 9^x + 5 \times 3^x -2 = 0$.
3. [Maximum mark: 7] Quadrilateral $OABC$ is shown on the following set of axes. $OABC$ is symmetrical about [$OB$]. $A$ has coordinates $(6,0)$ and $C$ has coordinates $(3,3\sqrt 3)$.
  a) i) Write down the coordinates of the midpoint of $[AC]$.
     ii) Hence or otherwise, find the equation of the line passing through the points $O$ and $B$.
  b) Given that $[OA]$ is perpendicular to $[AB]$, find the area of the quadrilateral $OABC$.
