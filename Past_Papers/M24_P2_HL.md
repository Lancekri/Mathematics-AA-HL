[Maximum rank: 6]<br>
The functions $f$ and $g$ are both defined for $-1 \leq x \leq 0$ by <br>
```math
f(x) = 1 - x^2
```
```math
g(x) = e^{2x}
```
The graphs of $f$ and $g$ intersect at $x=a$ and $x=b$, where $a<b$. <br>
**(a) Find the value of $a$ and the value of $b$.** <br>
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  $f(x) = g(x)$<br>
  $1-x^2 = e^{2x}$<br>
  Using GDC:<br>
  $b = -0.917$<br>
  $a = 0$
</details>

**(b) Find the area of the region enclosed by the graphs of $$f$$ and $g$.**
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  $A = \int^a_b g(x) - f(x) dx$ <br><br>
  $A = \int^{0}_{-0.917} |1-x^2-e^{2x}| dx$ <br><br>
  $= x-\frac{1}{3}x^3-\frac{1}{2}e^{2x} \Big|^0_{-0.917}$

Consider the differential equation $\dfrac{dy}{dx} - y\csc 2x = \sqrt{\tan x}$, where $0 < x < \dfrac{\pi}{2}$ and $y = \dfrac{\pi}{4}$ at $x = \dfrac{\pi}{4}$.

(a) Use Euler's method with step length $\dfrac{\pi}{12}$ to find an approximate value of $y$ when $x = \dfrac{5\pi}{12}$. <br>
Give your answer correct to three significant figures.<br>

(b) Show that $\dfrac{d}{dx}(\dfrac{1}{2}\ln(\cot x)) = -2 \csc 2x$.

(c) Show that $\sqrt{\cot x}$ is an integrating factor for this differential equation. 

(d) Hence, by solving the differential equation, show that $y = x\sqrt{\tan x}$.
