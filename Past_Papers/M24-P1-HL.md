<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  $$\tan(2x-5\degree) = 1$$<br>
  $$2x-5\degree = \arctan 1$$ <br>
  $$225\degree, 45\degree = 2x-5\degree$$<br>
  $$40\degree = 2x$$<br>
  $$x = 25\degree, 115\degree$$

## <ins>Question 2</ins>
[Maximum mark: 5] Solve $3 \times 9^x + 5 \times 3^x -2 = 0$.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  $3 \times 9^x + 5 \times 3^x -2 = 0$ <br>
  $3 \times 3^{2x} + 5 \times 3^x - 2 = 0$ <br>
  $\text {Let } 3^x = u$ <br>
  $3u^2 + 5u -2 = 0$ <br><br>
  $$u = \dfrac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^{2} - 4 \times 3 \times (-2)}}{2\times3} = \dfrac{-5 \pm 7}{6}$$ <br><br>
  $\therefore 3^x = \dfrac{-5 + 7}{6} = \dfrac{2}{6} = \dfrac{1}{3} = 3^{-1}$ <br><br>
  $\text{or } 3^x = \dfrac{-5 - 7}{6} = \dfrac{-12}{6} = -2 = \text{No real solutions}$ <br><br>
  $x = -1$

  (a) (i) Write down the coordinates of the midpoint of $\text{[AC]}$.<br>
  <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    $(\dfrac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \dfrac{y_1+y_2}{2}) = (\dfrac{9}{2}, \dfrac{3\sqrt 3}{2})$
  </details><br>

  (ii) Hence or otherwise, find the equation of the line passing through the points $\text O$ and $\text B$.
  <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    $\text{AC} \perp \text{OB} \Rightarrow m_{AC} \cdot m_{OB} = -1$<br><br>
    $m_{OB} = \dfrac{-1}{\dfrac{3\sqrt3}{-3}} = \dfrac{\sqrt 3}{3}$<br><br>
    $\therefore y = \dfrac{\sqrt 3}{3} x$
  </details><br>

  (b) Given that $\text{[OA]}$ is perpendicular to $\text{[AB]}$, find the area of the quadrilateral $\text{OABC}$.<br>
  <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    $\text {At B}, x = 6 \Rightarrow y = 2\sqrt 3$<br>
    $\text{Area} = (\frac{1}{2} bh)2 = bh = 12\sqrt3 \text{ units}^2$

A species of bird can nest in two seasons: Spring and Summer. 

The probability of nesting in Spring is $k$.

The probability of nesting in Summer is $\dfrac{k}{2}$

It is known that hte probability of not nesting in Spring and not nesting in Summer is $\dfrac{5}{9}$.<br>

(b) (i) Show that $9k^2 - 27k + 8 = 0$<br>
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  $(1-k)(1-\dfrac{k}{2}) = \frac{5}{9}$
  $9k^2-27k+8 = 0$
</details>

(ii) Both $k = \dfrac{1}{3}$ and $k = \dfrac{8}{3}$ satisfy $9k^2 - 27k + 8 = 0$.<br>
State why $k = \dfrac{1}{3}$ is the only valid solution.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  $\frac{8}{3} > 1$ and $0 \leq k \leq 1$ because $k$ must be a probability.

(a) Write down the equation of the horizontal asymptote.
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Horizontal asymptote at $y = \dfrac{2}{3}$

Consider $g(x) = mx + 1$, where $m \in \mathbb{R}$, $m \neq 0$.

(b) (i) Write down the number of solutions to $\text{f}(x) = g(x)$ for $m > 0$.
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <br>
  $\dfrac{2(x+3)}{3(x+2)} = (mx + 1)$ <br><br>
  $2(x+3) = 3(x+2)(mx + 1)$ <br>
  $0 = 3mx^2 + (1+6m)x$ <br>
  $\Delta = (1+6m)^2 - 4(3m)(0)$ <br>
  $\Delta = (1+6m)^2 > 0$ <br>
  $\Rightarrow \text{Two solutions}$
</details>

(ii) Determine the value of $m$ such that $\text{f}(x) = g(x)$ has only one solution for $x$. 
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  $\text{One solution} \Rightarrow \Delta = 0$<br>
  $0 = (1+6m)^2$ <br>
  $m = -\dfrac{1}{6}$
</details>

(iii) Determine the range of values for $m$, where $\text{f}(x) = g(x)$ has two solutions for $x\geq 0$. 
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  For 2 solutions: <br> 
  $(1+6m)^2 > 0 \Rightarrow m > -\dfrac{1}{6}$<br><br>
  
  Solutions are: <br>
  $x = \dfrac{-(1+6m) \pm \sqrt{(1+6m)^2}}{6m}$<br>
  $x_1 = 0$ <br>
  $x_2 = \dfrac{-(1+6m)}{3m}$ <br><br>

  $-\dfrac{1}{6} \leq m < 0$

## <ins>Question 6</ins>
[Maximum mark: 5]

A farmer grows two types of apples -- cooking apples and eating apples. The weights of the apples, in grams, can be modelled as normal distributions with the following parameters.

| **Apple type** | **Mean $\mu$** | **Standard deviation $\sigma$** |
| :---           | :---:          | :---:                           |
| Eating         | $100 g$        | $20 g$                          |
| Cooking        | $140 g$        | $40 g$                          |

For each type of apple you can assume that $95%$ of the weights are within two standard deviations of the mean.

(a) Find the percentage of eating apples that have a weight greater than $140 g$.

The farmer grows a large number of apples of which $80%$ are eating apples. 

Both types of apples are picked and randomly mixed together in a cleaning machine. 

After cleaning, the machine separates out those that have a weight greater than $140 g$ into a container.

(b) An apple is randomly selected from this container. Find the probability that it is an eating apple. Give your answer in the form $\dfrac{c}{d}$, where $c$, $d \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.
